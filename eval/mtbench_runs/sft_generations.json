Photosynthesis is a complex process that occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, and it can be divided into two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle).\n\n1. Light-dependent reactions:\n\nThe light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts. These reactions are driven by light energy, which is absorbed by pigments such as chlorophyll. The primary inputs for this stage are water (H2O) and light energy, and the primary outputs are ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate).\n\nDuring the light-dependent reactions, water molecules are split by the enzyme photosystem II, releasing oxygen gas (O2) as a byproduct. The energy from the light is used to create a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane, which drives the synthesis of ATP by the enzyme ATP synthase. The energy from the light is also used to reduce NADP+","Estimating the total amount of energy a tree can produce through photosynthesis in its lifetime is a complex calculation that involves several factors, including the tree's size, growth rate, and the amount of sunlight it receives.
